The Descriptive Menu Widget adds a WordPress menu to a page and includes each menu item's description.

The Descriptive Menu Widget takes the manual work out of rendering a WordPress menu with menu item descriptions. Built for those experienced with CSS, the generated markup gives you full control over how your menu is displayed, including an optional icon element.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the files to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place the widget in the sidebar of your choice.
4. Style the way you want!
